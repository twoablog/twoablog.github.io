My short description "A blog about code, tech and everything" is a clear giveaway that I had no idea what I was doing when I started it. I studied mathematics for a decade, all the while feeling like I should get my feet back on the ground and try to apply some of the things I was learning. As a result I became a software developer to make a palpable contribution to the world, without having to abandon mathematics entirely.

Even though the boundary between mathematics and programming is blurred, I still miss the deeper challenges of mathematical research. They certainly pop up here and there in the development of new programming languages and paradigms, or when optimizing algorithms and data structures. But, to be honest, in production code serious mental challenges are a rare commodity that has to be enjoyed up to the last drop.

So I decided to create a free and flexible channel to share my thoughts, whenever I believe they might be of interest to anyone else, about software development, mathematics and my favourite one: that blurred boundary between them, where all you can see is a beautiful milkshake of logic.

If you're here for the code, you should know most of my programming experience has been with __C++__ and __swift__, and these also happen to be my favourite languages, so there should be very little content about or using any other ones.
